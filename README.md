Sure, let's go through the steps to implement question deletion in your application.

Step 1: Update the `onQuestionDelete` method in the `ExamEditorActivity` class.

Open the `ExamEditorActivity` class and locate the `onQuestionDelete` method. Update it with the following code:

```java
public void onQuestionDelete(Question question) {
    // Find the index of the question to be deleted
    int index = questionManager.getQuestions().indexOf(question);

    if (index != -1) {
        // Delete the question from the QuestionManager
        questionManager.deleteQuestion(index);

        // Notify the adapter about the data change
        questionAdapter.notifyItemRemoved(index);

        // Delete the question from Firestore
        FirestoreManager.getInstance().deleteQuestionFromFirestore(examManager.getExamId(), question.getId());
    }
}
```

This method finds the index of the question to be deleted, removes it from the `QuestionManager`, notifies the adapter about the data change, and then calls the `deleteQuestionFromFirestore` method from the `FirestoreManager` class to delete the question document from Firestore.

Step 2: Add the `deleteQuestionFromFirestore` method to the `FirestoreManager` class.

Open the `FirestoreManager` class and add the following method:

```java
public void deleteQuestionFromFirestore(String examId, String questionId) {
    db.collection("exams")
            .document(examId)
            .collection("questions")
            .document(questionId)
            .delete();
}
```

This method deletes the question document from the "questions" collection in Firestore using the provided `examId` and `questionId`.

After making these changes, you should be able to delete questions from both the local `QuestionManager` and the Firestore database.

Note: Make sure that the `QuestionManager` class has a `deleteQuestion` method that removes the question from the local list of questions. If not, you'll need to add it.

Here's an example implementation of the `deleteQuestion` method in the `QuestionManager` class:

```java
public void deleteQuestion(int index) {
    if (index >= 0 && index < questions.size()) {
        questions.remove(index);
    }
}
```

With these changes, you should be able to delete questions correctly from both the local data and the Firestore database.
