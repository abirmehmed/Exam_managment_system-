Sure, let's integrate Firebase Firestore into your project and save the exam data, including the exam details, questions, options, and answers.

Here are the steps you need to follow:

1. **Set up Firebase in your Android project**
   - If you haven't already, follow the official Firebase documentation to add Firebase to your Android project: https://firebase.google.com/docs/android/setup
   - Enable the Firestore database in the Firebase console.

2. **Add Firebase Firestore dependency**
   - In your app-level `build.gradle` file, add the following dependency:
     ```
     implementation 'com.google.firebase:firebase-firestore:24.6.0'
     ```

3. **Create a data model for the exam**
   - Create a new Java class called `Exam` to represent the exam data. This class should have fields for the exam name, date, duration, and a list of questions.
   - Create another Java class called `Question` to represent the question data. This class should have fields for the question text, question type, options (for multiple-choice questions), and the answer.

4. **Save the exam data to Firestore**
   - In your `ExamEditorActivity`, create a method to save the exam data to Firestore. This method should be called when the "Save Exam" button is clicked.
   - Use the `FirebaseFirestore` instance to create a new document in the "exams" collection with the exam data.
   - For each question in the exam, create a subcollection called "questions" under the exam document and add the question data as a new document in that subcollection.

Here's an example implementation of the `saveExamToFirestore` method:

```java
private void saveExamToFirestore() {
    // Get the exam data from the UI
    String examName = etExamName.getText().toString().trim();
    String examDate = etExamDate.getText().toString().trim();
    String examDuration = etExamDuration.getText().toString().trim();

    // Create a new Exam object
    Exam exam = new Exam(examName, examDate, examDuration, questions);

    // Save the exam data to Firestore
    FirebaseFirestore db = FirebaseFirestore.getInstance();
    db.collection("exams")
        .add(exam)
        .addOnSuccessListener(documentReference -> {
            // Exam document created successfully
            String examId = documentReference.getId();

            // Save the questions as subcollections
            for (int i = 0; i < questions.size(); i++) {
                Question question = questions.get(i);
                db.collection("exams")
                    .document(examId)
                    .collection("questions")
                    .add(question)
                    .addOnSuccessListener(questionDocRef -> {
                        // Question document created successfully
                    })
                    .addOnFailureListener(e -> {
                        // Error creating question document
                    });
            }
        })
        .addOnFailureListener(e -> {
            // Error creating exam document
        });
}
```

In this example, the `saveExamToFirestore` method retrieves the exam data from the UI, creates an `Exam` object, and then saves the exam data to the "exams" collection in Firestore. For each question in the exam, it creates a subcollection called "questions" under the exam document and adds the question data as a new document in that subcollection.

5. **Retrieve the exam data from Firestore**
   - In your `ExamEditorActivity`, create a method to retrieve the exam data from Firestore. This method should be called when the activity is created or when the user navigates to this activity.
   - Use the `FirebaseFirestore` instance to retrieve the exam documents from the "exams" collection.
   - For each exam document, retrieve the exam details and the questions from the "questions" subcollection.
   - Populate the UI with the retrieved exam data.

Here's an example implementation of the `retrieveExamsFromFirestore` method:

```java
private void retrieveExamsFromFirestore() {
    FirebaseFirestore db = FirebaseFirestore.getInstance();
    db.collection("exams")
        .get()
        .addOnSuccessListener(queryDocumentSnapshots -> {
            for (QueryDocumentSnapshot documentSnapshot : queryDocumentSnapshots) {
                Exam exam = documentSnapshot.toObject(Exam.class);
                String examId = documentSnapshot.getId();

                // Retrieve the questions for this exam
                db.collection("exams")
                    .document(examId)
                    .collection("questions")
                    .get()
                    .addOnSuccessListener(questionSnapshots -> {
                        List<Question> questions = new ArrayList<>();
                        for (QueryDocumentSnapshot questionSnapshot : questionSnapshots) {
                            Question question = questionSnapshot.toObject(Question.class);
                            questions.add(question);
                        }
                        exam.setQuestions(questions);

                        // Add the exam to the list or update the UI
                        // ...
                    })
                    .addOnFailureListener(e -> {
                        // Error retrieving questions
                    });
            }
        })
        .addOnFailureListener(e -> {
            // Error retrieving exams
        });
}
```

In this example, the `retrieveExamsFromFirestore` method retrieves the exam documents from the "exams" collection in Firestore. For each exam document, it retrieves the exam details and then retrieves the questions from the "questions" subcollection. It creates a list of `Question` objects and sets them in the `Exam` object. You can then add the `Exam` object to a list or update the UI accordingly.

Note: Make sure to create the `Exam` and `Question` data model classes with the appropriate fields and constructors to match the data structure in Firestore.

By following these steps, you should be able to save the exam data, including the exam details, questions, options, and answers, to Firestore when the "Save Exam" button is clicked. Additionally, you should be able to retrieve the exam data from Firestore and populate the UI when the `ExamEditorActivity` is created or navigated to.

Remember to handle any necessary error cases and provide appropriate feedback to the user. Also, make sure to follow the Firebase security rules and best practices to ensure the security and integrity of your data.
