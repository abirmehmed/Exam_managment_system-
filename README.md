To achieve the desired functionality in the `QuestionEditorActivity`, you'll need to implement some logic in the Java code to handle the different question types and dynamically update the UI accordingly. Here's a step-by-step guide on how you can approach this:

1. **Initialize the UI elements in the `onCreate` method**:
   - Find and initialize the `EditText` views for the question text (`et_question_text`) and answer (`et_question_answer`).
   - Find and initialize the `Spinner` for the question type (`spinner_question_type`).
   - Find and initialize the `LinearLayout` for the question options (`ll_question_options`).

2. **Set up the `Spinner` for the question types**:
   - Create a `String` array resource (`question_types.xml`) in the `res/values` folder with the question type options (e.g., "Multiple Choice", "True/False", "Short Answer").
   - In the `onCreate` method, set up an `OnItemSelectedListener` for the `spinner_question_type` to listen for changes in the selected question type.

3. **Handle the question type selection**:
   - In the `OnItemSelectedListener` of the `spinner_question_type`, implement logic to show or hide the relevant UI elements based on the selected question type.
   - For "Multiple Choice" questions:
     - Show the `ll_question_options` `LinearLayout`.
     - Dynamically add `EditText` views to the `ll_question_options` for the user to enter the options (you can create a fixed number of options, e.g., 4).
     - Show the `et_question_answer` `EditText` for the user to enter the correct answer.
   - For "True/False" questions:
     - Show the `ll_question_options` `LinearLayout`.
     - Dynamically add two `EditText` views to the `ll_question_options` with the text "True" and "False".
     - Show the `et_question_answer` `EditText` for the user to enter the correct answer ("True" or "False").
   - For "Short Answer" questions:
     - Hide the `ll_question_options` `LinearLayout`.
     - Show the `et_question_answer` `EditText` for the user to enter the correct answer.

4. **Implement the "Save" button functionality**:
   - Set an `OnClickListener` for the `btn_save_question` button.
   - In the `onClick` method, retrieve the user input from the relevant UI elements based on the selected question type.
   - Create a new `Question` object with the retrieved data.
   - Set the result and finish the activity, passing the new `Question` object back to the `ExamEditorActivity`.

5. **Implement the "Delete" button functionality (if needed)**:
   - Set an `OnClickListener` for the `btn_delete_question` button.
   - In the `onClick` method, implement the logic to delete the question (if applicable).

By following these steps, you'll be able to create a dynamic UI that adapts to the selected question type, allowing the user to enter the necessary information for each type of question. Additionally, you'll be able to save the new question and pass it back to the `ExamEditorActivity` for further processing.

Note: You'll need to implement the necessary methods and logic in the `QuestionEditorActivity` Java class to handle the UI updates, user input, and result passing. The provided code snippets are just guidelines, and you'll need to adapt them to your specific implementation.
