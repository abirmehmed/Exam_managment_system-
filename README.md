Based on the data you provided, it seems that the issue is related to how the question IDs are being generated and handled in your application.

In the data you shared, you can see that there are multiple questions with the same ID, such as `"ba4b9463-2ef2-4e00-bb06-27c8182803c3"`. This is likely causing the duplication of questions in your Firestore database.

Regarding the question IDs, it appears that you are generating random UUIDs (Universally Unique Identifiers) for each new question. This is a common practice to ensure that each question has a unique identifier, but it can lead to issues if the IDs are not properly managed.

To address this issue, you should consider the following changes:

1. **Generate question IDs in the server-side (Firestore)**:
   Instead of generating random UUIDs for question IDs in your application, you should let Firestore generate the document IDs automatically when you create new questions. This way, you can ensure that each question has a unique ID, and you don't have to worry about managing the IDs yourself.

2. **Update the `Question` class**:
   Remove the `id` field from the `Question` class, as the question ID will be the document ID in Firestore.

3. **Update the `saveQuestionsToFirestore` method**:
   In the `saveQuestionsToFirestore` method of the `FirestoreManager` class, instead of creating new documents with random IDs, you should let Firestore generate the document IDs automatically. Here's how you can update the method:

```java
private Task<Void> saveQuestionsToFirestore(String examId, List<Question> newQuestions, List<Question> existingQuestions) {
    WriteBatch batch = db.batch();

    // Delete new questions from the existing list
    for (Question newQuestion : newQuestions) {
        existingQuestions.remove(newQuestion);
    }

    // Delete removed questions from Firestore
    for (Question removedQuestion : existingQuestions) {
        batch.delete(db.collection("exams").document(examId).collection("questions").document(removedQuestion.getId()));
    }

    // Save new questions
    for (Question newQuestion : newQuestions) {
        DocumentReference questionRef = db.collection("exams").document(examId).collection("questions").document();
        batch.set(questionRef, newQuestion.toMap());
    }

    // Update existing questions
    for (Question existingQuestion : existingQuestions) {
        DocumentReference questionRef = db.collection("exams").document(examId).collection("questions").document(existingQuestion.getId());
        batch.set(questionRef, existingQuestion.toMap());
    }

    return batch.commit();
}
```

In this updated method, we're letting Firestore generate the document IDs automatically when saving new questions by using `db.collection("exams").document(examId).collection("questions").document()`.

4. **Update the `deleteQuestionFromFirestore` method**:
   Since the question IDs will now be the document IDs in Firestore, you need to update the `deleteQuestionFromFirestore` method to use the document ID instead of the `questionId`. Here's the updated method:

```java
public void deleteQuestionFromFirestore(String examId, String questionDocumentId) {
    db.collection("exams")
            .document(examId)
            .collection("questions")
            .document(questionDocumentId)
            .delete();
}
```

5. **Update the `onQuestionDeleted` method**:
   In the `onQuestionDeleted` method of the `ExamEditorActivity` class, you need to update the call to `deleteQuestionFromFirestore` to pass the document ID of the question instead of the `questionId`. Here's the updated method:

```java
public void onQuestionDeleted(Question question) {
    // Find the index of the question to be deleted
    int index = questionManager.getQuestions().indexOf(question);

    if (index != -1) {
        // Delete the question from the QuestionManager
        questionManager.deleteQuestion(index);

        // Notify the adapter about the data change
        questionAdapter.notifyItemRemoved(index);

        // Delete the question from Firestore
        FirestoreManager.getInstance().deleteQuestionFromFirestore(examManager.getExamId(), question.getDocumentId());

        // Update the exam in Firestore with the updated question list
        List<Question> updatedQuestions = new ArrayList<>(questionManager.getQuestions());
        FirestoreManager.getInstance().updateExistingExam(examManager.getExamId(), examManager.getExamTitle(), examManager.getExamDate(), examManager.getExamDuration(), updatedQuestions);
    }
}
```

In this updated method, we're passing `question.getDocumentId()` to the `deleteQuestionFromFirestore` method, assuming that the `Question` class has a `getDocumentId()` method that returns the document ID of the question in Firestore.

By making these changes, you should be able to avoid question duplication and handle question IDs correctly in your application. Firestore will generate unique document IDs for each new question, and you won't have to worry about managing the IDs yourself.

Note: If you have existing questions in your Firestore database with the old ID format (UUIDs), you may need to migrate the data to use the new document IDs generated by Firestore.
