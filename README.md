To implement the exam editor functionality, you'll need to create the following components:

1. **Layouts**:
   - `activity_exam_editor.xml` or `fragment_exam_editor.xml`: The main layout for the exam editor screen.
   - `item_question.xml`: The layout for each question item in the exam.
   - `dialog_add_question.xml`: The layout for the dialog or activity to add a new question.

2. **Activities/Fragments**:
   - `ExamEditorActivity` or `ExamEditorFragment`: The main class that handles the exam editing functionality.
   - `AddQuestionDialogFragment` or `AddQuestionActivity`: The class that handles the addition of new questions.

3. **Adapters**:
   - `QuestionAdapter`: The adapter class that manages the list of questions in the exam.

4. **Models**:
   - `Question`: The data model class for a single question.
   - `Exam`: The data model class for the complete exam, including the questions.

5. **Utilities**:
   - `QuestionFactory`: A utility class to create different types of questions (multiple-choice, true/false, short answer, etc.).
   - `DragAndDropHelper`: A utility class to handle the drag-and-drop functionality for rearranging questions.

Here's a breakdown of the components and their responsibilities:

1. **Layouts**:
   - `activity_exam_editor.xml` or `fragment_exam_editor.xml`: Provides the UI structure for the exam editor screen, including the toolbar, the question list, and the floating action button to add new questions.
   - `item_question.xml`: Defines the layout for each individual question item, including the question text, question type-specific UI elements (e.g., radio buttons, text fields), and any additional controls.
   - `dialog_add_question.xml`: Defines the layout for the dialog or activity that allows the user to select the question type and create a new question.

2. **Activities/Fragments**:
   - `ExamEditorActivity` or `ExamEditorFragment`: Handles the logic for loading the exam framework, displaying the question list, adding/editing/deleting questions, and saving the complete exam data to Firestore.
   - `AddQuestionDialogFragment` or `AddQuestionActivity`: Handles the logic for creating a new question, including selecting the question type and initializing the appropriate UI elements.

3. **Adapters**:
   - `QuestionAdapter`: Manages the list of questions in the exam, providing methods to add, update, and remove questions, as well as handle the drag-and-drop functionality for rearranging the questions.

4. **Models**:
   - `Question`: Represents a single question, including its type, text, and any additional data required for the specific question type (e.g., options for multiple-choice, correct answer for true/false).
   - `Exam`: Represents the complete exam, including the exam framework data (title, date, duration) and the list of questions.

5. **Utilities**:
   - `QuestionFactory`: Provides methods to create different types of questions (multiple-choice, true/false, short answer, etc.), ensuring consistency in the question creation process.
   - `DragAndDropHelper`: Handles the logic for the drag-and-drop functionality, allowing the user to rearrange the order of the questions in the exam.

By creating these components, you'll have a well-structured and modular codebase that can handle the exam editing functionality effectively. This approach will also make it easier to maintain and extend the app in the future.
