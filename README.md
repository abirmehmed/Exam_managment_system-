Sure, let's go through the steps to update your code and handle question IDs correctly.

Step 1: Update the `Question` class

Open the `Question` class and remove the `id` field, as the question ID will be the document ID in Firestore.

Step 2: Update the `saveQuestionsToFirestore` method in the `FirestoreManager` class

Open the `FirestoreManager` class and locate the `saveQuestionsToFirestore` method. Update it with the following code:

```java
private Task<Void> saveQuestionsToFirestore(String examId, List<Question> newQuestions, List<Question> existingQuestions) {
    WriteBatch batch = db.batch();

    // Delete new questions from the existing list
    for (Question newQuestion : newQuestions) {
        existingQuestions.remove(newQuestion);
    }

    // Delete removed questions from Firestore
    for (Question removedQuestion : existingQuestions) {
        batch.delete(db.collection("exams").document(examId).collection("questions").document(removedQuestion.getDocumentId()));
    }

    // Save new questions
    for (Question newQuestion : newQuestions) {
        DocumentReference questionRef = db.collection("exams").document(examId).collection("questions").document();
        batch.set(questionRef, newQuestion.toMap());
    }

    // Update existing questions
    for (Question existingQuestion : existingQuestions) {
        DocumentReference questionRef = db.collection("exams").document(examId).collection("questions").document(existingQuestion.getDocumentId());
        batch.set(questionRef, existingQuestion.toMap());
    }

    return batch.commit();
}
```

In this updated method, we're letting Firestore generate the document IDs automatically when saving new questions by using `db.collection("exams").document(examId).collection("questions").document()`.

Step 3: Update the `deleteQuestionFromFirestore` method in the `FirestoreManager` class

Locate the `deleteQuestionFromFirestore` method in the `FirestoreManager` class and update it with the following code:

```java
public void deleteQuestionFromFirestore(String examId, String questionDocumentId) {
    db.collection("exams")
            .document(examId)
            .collection("questions")
            .document(questionDocumentId)
            .delete();
}
```

In this updated method, we're using the document ID of the question to delete it from Firestore.

Step 4: Update the `onQuestionDeleted` method in the `ExamEditorActivity` class

Open the `ExamEditorActivity` class and locate the `onQuestionDeleted` method. Update it with the following code:

```java
public void onQuestionDeleted(Question question) {
    // Find the index of the question to be deleted
    int index = questionManager.getQuestions().indexOf(question);

    if (index != -1) {
        // Delete the question from the QuestionManager
        questionManager.deleteQuestion(index);

        // Notify the adapter about the data change
        questionAdapter.notifyItemRemoved(index);

        // Delete the question from Firestore
        FirestoreManager.getInstance().deleteQuestionFromFirestore(examManager.getExamId(), question.getDocumentId());

        // Update the exam in Firestore with the updated question list
        List<Question> updatedQuestions = new ArrayList<>(questionManager.getQuestions());
        FirestoreManager.getInstance().updateExistingExam(examManager.getExamId(), examManager.getExamTitle(), examManager.getExamDate(), examManager.getExamDuration(), updatedQuestions);
    }
}
```

In this updated method, we're passing `question.getDocumentId()` to the `deleteQuestionFromFirestore` method, assuming that the `Question` class has a `getDocumentId()` method that returns the document ID of the question in Firestore.

Step 5: Add the `getDocumentId` method to the `Question` class (if not already present)

Open the `Question` class and add the following method:

```java
public String getDocumentId() {
    // Return the document ID of the question in Firestore
    // If you're storing the document ID as a field, return that field
    // Otherwise, you can return null or throw an exception
    return null;
}
```

This method should return the document ID of the question in Firestore. If you're storing the document ID as a field in the `Question` class, you can return that field. Otherwise, you can return `null` or throw an exception, depending on your implementation.

After making these changes, your application should handle question IDs correctly, and you should no longer encounter issues with question duplication. Firestore will generate unique document IDs for each new question, and you won't have to worry about managing the IDs yourself.

Note: If you have existing questions in your Firestore database with the old ID format (UUIDs), you may need to migrate the data to use the new document IDs generated by Firestore.
