Sure, here's a step-by-step algorithmic guide to help you solve the Firebase Storage upload issue:

1. **Verify Storage Path**
   - Get the current user's unique identifier (UID) using `currentUser.getUid()`.
   - Check if the storage path `"profile_pictures/" + currentUser.getUid() + ".jpg"` is correct.
   - If the path is incorrect, update it with the correct path.

2. **Check Firebase Storage Rules**
   - Open the Firebase Console in your web browser.
   - Navigate to your project.
   - Click on the "Storage" section in the left-hand menu.
   - Click on the "Rules" tab.
   - Check if the rules allow write operations for authenticated users.
   - If the rules do not allow write operations, update the rules as follows:
     ```
     rules_version = '2';
     service firebase.storage {
       match /b/{bucket}/o {
         match /{allPaths=**} {
           allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
         }
       }
     }
     ```
   - Save the updated rules.

3. **Verify User Authentication**
   - In your `LoginActivity` class, add the following line of code before calling `uploadImageToFirebaseStorage`:
     ```kotlin
     Log.d("LoginActivity", "Current user: $currentUser")
     ```
   - Check the Android Studio Logcat for the logged message.
   - If the logged message shows `"Current user: null"`, the user is not authenticated.
   - Handle the case where the user is not authenticated appropriately.

4. **Check Internet Connection**
   - Ensure that your device or emulator has a stable internet connection.
   - You can check the internet connection by opening a web browser or using a network testing tool.

5. **Enable Firebase Storage Logging**
   - In your `TeacherHomepageActivity` class, add the following line of code before calling `uploadImageToFirebaseStorage`:
     ```kotlin
     FirebaseStorage.getInstance().setMaxUploadRetryTimeMillis(2000)
     ```
   - This will log detailed information about the upload process to the Android Studio Logcat.

6. **Analyze the Logs**
   - Check the Android Studio Logcat for any relevant error messages or logs related to the upload failure.
   - Analyze the logs to identify the root cause of the issue.

7. **Retry the Upload**
   - After addressing any issues identified in the previous steps, try uploading the image again by clicking the profile picture button in your app.

8. **Seek Further Assistance**
   - If the issue persists after following these steps, provide the relevant logs and error messages to seek further assistance from the community or Firebase support.

By following this algorithmic guide step-by-step, you should be able to identify and resolve the issue with uploading images to Firebase Storage. If the problem persists, you can provide more detailed information, such as the logs and error messages, for further troubleshooting.
