I apologize for the confusion and the issues you're facing. It seems like there are multiple problems with the way questions are being handled in your application. Let's address them one by one:

1. **Question Duplication**:
   The issue of question duplication could be caused by the way you're updating the questions in Firestore. Instead of deleting all existing questions and then saving the new and existing questions, we should update the questions individually.

   Here's how you can update the `saveQuestionsToFirestore` method to avoid question duplication:

   ```java
   private Task<Void> saveQuestionsToFirestore(String examId, List<Question> newQuestions, List<Question> existingQuestions) {
       WriteBatch batch = db.batch();

       // Delete new questions from the existing list
       for (Question newQuestion : newQuestions) {
           existingQuestions.remove(newQuestion);
       }

       // Delete removed questions from Firestore
       for (Question removedQuestion : existingQuestions) {
           DocumentReference questionRef = db.collection("exams").document(examId).collection("questions").document(removedQuestion.getId());
           batch.delete(questionRef);
       }

       // Save new questions
       for (Question newQuestion : newQuestions) {
           DocumentReference questionRef = db.collection("exams").document(examId).collection("questions").document();
           batch.set(questionRef, newQuestion.toMap());
       }

       // Update existing questions
       for (Question existingQuestion : existingQuestions) {
           DocumentReference questionRef = db.collection("exams").document(examId).collection("questions").document(existingQuestion.getId());
           batch.set(questionRef, existingQuestion.toMap());
       }

       return batch.commit();
   }
   ```

   In this updated method, we're doing the following:
   - Removing the new questions from the existing questions list to avoid duplicates.
   - Deleting the removed questions from Firestore.
   - Saving the new questions by creating new documents.
   - Updating the existing questions by setting their data in their respective documents.

   This approach should prevent question duplication and ensure that the questions are updated correctly in Firestore.

2. **Real-time Updates**:
   To ensure that the changes are reflected in real-time on the front-end, you can use Firestore's real-time updates feature. Instead of fetching the questions from Firestore every time, you can listen for changes in the "questions" collection and update the UI accordingly.

   Here's how you can implement real-time updates in your `ExamEditorActivity`:

   ```java
   private ListenerRegistration questionsListener;

   @Override
   protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
       super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
       // ... (existing code)

       // Set up real-time updates for questions
       setupQuestionsListener(examId);
   }

   private void setupQuestionsListener(String examId) {
       questionsListener = FirestoreManager.getInstance().getDb()
               .collection("exams")
               .document(examId)
               .collection("questions")
               .addSnapshotListener((value, error) -> {
                   if (error != null) {
                       // Handle error
                       return;
                   }

                   List<Question> questions = new ArrayList<>();
                   for (DocumentSnapshot document : value.getDocuments()) {
                       Question question = document.toObject(Question.class);
                       questions.add(question);
                   }

                   // Update the QuestionManager and the adapter
                   questionManager.setQuestions(questions);
                   questionAdapter.setQuestions(questions);
               });
   }

   @Override
   protected void onDestroy() {
       super.onDestroy();
       // Remove the listener when the activity is destroyed
       if (questionsListener != null) {
           questionsListener.remove();
       }
   }
   ```

   In this implementation, we're setting up a real-time listener for the "questions" collection in the `setupQuestionsListener` method. Whenever there's a change in the "questions" collection, the listener will be triggered, and we'll update the `QuestionManager` and the `QuestionAdapter` with the latest questions.

   Additionally, we're removing the listener in the `onDestroy` method to prevent memory leaks.

   With this approach, the UI should update in real-time as questions are added, edited, or deleted.

3. **Question Deletion**:
   To delete a question, you can update the `onQuestionDelete` method to remove the question from Firestore using its document ID. Here's how you can modify the `onQuestionDelete` method:

   ```java
   public void onQuestionDelete(Question question) {
       // Find the index of the question to be deleted
       int index = questionManager.getQuestions().indexOf(question);

       if (index != -1) {
           // Delete the question from the QuestionManager
           questionManager.deleteQuestion(index);

           // Notify the adapter about the data change
           questionAdapter.notifyItemRemoved(index);

           // Delete the question from Firestore
           FirestoreManager.getInstance().deleteQuestionFromFirestore(examManager.getExamId(), question.getId());
       }
   }
   ```

   In this updated method, we're calling the `deleteQuestionFromFirestore` method from the `FirestoreManager` class and passing the `examId` and the `question.getId()` to delete the question document from Firestore.

   You'll need to add the `deleteQuestionFromFirestore` method to the `FirestoreManager` class:

   ```java
   public void deleteQuestionFromFirestore(String examId, String questionId) {
       db.collection("exams")
               .document(examId)
               .collection("questions")
               .document(questionId)
               .delete();
   }
   ```

   This method deletes the question document from the "questions" collection using the provided `questionId`.

By implementing these changes, you should be able to:
- Avoid question duplication
- Update the UI in real-time as questions are added, edited, or deleted
- Delete questions correctly from Firestore

If you still encounter issues after making these changes, please provide more details or any error messages you're receiving, and I'll be happy to assist you further.
