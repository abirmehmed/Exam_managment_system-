The error `java.lang.ClassCastException: android.app.Application cannot be cast to com.example.myapplication.activities.TeacherHomepageActivity` is occurring because you're trying to cast the application context to the `TeacherHomepageActivity` class, which is not correct.

The issue is in the `incrementExamsCreatedCount` method of your `ExamManagementActivity` class:

```java
private void incrementExamsCreatedCount() {
    // Get a reference to the TeacherHomepageActivity instance
    TeacherHomepageActivity teacherHomepageActivity = (TeacherHomepageActivity) getApplicationContext();

    // Call the incrementExamsCreatedCount method in the TeacherHomepageActivity
    teacherHomepageActivity.incrementExamsCreatedCount();
}
```

The `getApplicationContext()` method returns an instance of the `Application` class, which is the base class for maintaining global application state. However, you're trying to cast it to the `TeacherHomepageActivity` class, which is not a subclass of `Application`.

To fix this issue, you need to get a reference to the `TeacherHomepageActivity` instance in a different way. One approach is to use a static reference to the `TeacherHomepageActivity` instance in your `Application` class.

Here's how you can do it:

1. Create a custom `Application` class that extends `Application` and holds a static reference to the `TeacherHomepageActivity` instance:

```java
public class MyApplication extends Application {
    private static TeacherHomepageActivity teacherHomepageActivity;

    public static void setTeacherHomepageActivity(TeacherHomepageActivity activity) {
        teacherHomepageActivity = activity;
    }

    public static TeacherHomepageActivity getTeacherHomepageActivity() {
        return teacherHomepageActivity;
    }
}
```

2. In your `TeacherHomepageActivity` class, set the static reference to the activity instance in the `onCreate` method:

```java
@Override
protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
    setContentView(R.layout.activity_teacher_homepage);

    // ... (other initialization code)

    MyApplication.setTeacherHomepageActivity(this);
}
```

3. In your `ExamManagementActivity` class, get the reference to the `TeacherHomepageActivity` instance from the `MyApplication` class:

```java
private void incrementExamsCreatedCount() {
    // Get a reference to the TeacherHomepageActivity instance
    TeacherHomepageActivity teacherHomepageActivity = MyApplication.getTeacherHomepageActivity();

    // Call the incrementExamsCreatedCount method in the TeacherHomepageActivity
    if (teacherHomepageActivity != null) {
        teacherHomepageActivity.incrementExamsCreatedCount();
    }
}
```

4. Don't forget to register your custom `MyApplication` class in the `AndroidManifest.xml` file:

```xml
<application
    android:name=".MyApplication"
    ...>
    <!-- Your activities and other components -->
</application>
```

By following these steps, you should be able to get a reference to the `TeacherHomepageActivity` instance correctly and call the `incrementExamsCreatedCount` method without encountering the `ClassCastException`.

As for the `id` field being `null` in your Firestore documents, the solution I provided earlier should work correctly. The Firestore security rules you provided should allow authenticated users to read and write documents in the "exams" collection and the "questions" subcollection.

If you're still encountering issues with the `id` field being `null`, please double-check your code where you're creating or updating the exam documents in Firestore, and ensure that you're setting the `id` field correctly using the automatically generated document ID.
